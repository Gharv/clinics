`r tufte::margin_note("Question 1 -- What is the difference between an anecdote and scientific knowledge?  Or is there a difference?")`

Crest recently began advertising their newest product -- *Gum Detoxify Deep Clean Toothpaste*.  The company claims that Gum Detoxify "has an activated foam formula ... to neutralize harmful plaque bacteria even around the gum line, for clinically proven healthier gums."

Recently, Ginger Vitas, a vice-president at *Consumer Reports*, asked your lab to independently verify this claim.  The problem, as Ginger puts it, is that a lot of dental product research is funded by big corporations with a vested interest in achieving positive outcomes.

In this clinic, we will walk you through the basics of the scientific method and the process a scientist would undertake to either confirm or refute a claim like the one being made by Crest, using nothing more than basic statistics.  As this is but a basic introduction, advanced methods will not be presented here.

You already know - from your knowledge of oral microbiology - that a subset of bacterial species are responsible for gingivitis, cavities, and oral bleeding.  So the fundamental logic of our approach ought to be clear.  If *Gum Detoxify* works, as Crest claims, we should see less gingivitis and bleeding in populations that use it on a regular basis. 

`r tufte::margin_note("Question 2 -- How would you design an experiment to justify or invalidate Crest's claims?")`

In the research literature, the symbol for the null hypothesis is $H_{0}$, spoken as H naught or H zero.  The alternative hypothesis, on the other hand, is $H_{a}$.  Remember: one never accepts the null hypothesis.  Rather, one *rejects* or *fails to reject* it.
